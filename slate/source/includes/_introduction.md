# Introduction

Zillabyte is an analysis platform for developers.  It allows developers to focus on building their unique applications instead of low level infrastructure.

Because it is hosted in the cloud, Zillabyte can handle most of the pitfalls associated with large-scale & distributed analysis.  Further, as a central location of algorithms, Zillabyte allows developers easily build upon others' contributions.

The central unit in Zillabyte is called a "Data App."  A Data App is a block of code that inputs data, performs one to many operations on it, and then produces a corresponding output.  Data may be [source'd](/quickstart/faq#whats_a_source) and [sink'ed](/quickstart/faq#whats_a_sink) from a variety of locations & formats, including Zillabyte's [Open Datasets](http://zillabyte.com/data), which includes an fresh crawl of the web, patents, etc.
