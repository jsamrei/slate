# Creating a Commerce Index

Zillabyte makes it aggregate data from the entire web and create an index based on your criteria. 

A Zillabyte customer came to us wanting to rank the web according to the use of commerce technologies. Using Zillabyte, she was able to write a bit of code and get her answer. Here's how you can do it as well. 



### The Code
```ruby
<%= link_file("../examples/index_commerce/app.rb") %>

```



### Push it to our servers

```bash
$ zillabyte push
```

### Now your algorithm is being processed with our infrastructure!
