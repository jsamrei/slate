# How To: Find Job Invites on the Web

One of Zillabyte's core principles is its flexibility.  Many websites expose information using RDF (Research Description Framework), a core component of W3C's semantic web stack.  This example demonstrates how one might process job openings on Indeed using a combination of Zillabyte's native features and its support for third-party gems.

### Use case
This use case actually grew out of something we are interested in here ate Zillabyte--namely, which companies are hiring full-time developers to perform large-scale data extraction and analysis tasks?  There are many aggregate job sites on the web, but this example just focuses on Indeed.

As mentioned above, Indeed uses RDF.  This is easy to determine by analyzing the source code of a search results page:

```html
<div class="row " id="p_c2c36f4266233baf" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/JobPosting">
```

The use of itemtype in particular is generally a strong clue that a site is using RDF.   Sites that use RDF encode semantic information alongside regular HTML tags describing relationships between entities on the page (or potentially across a larger scope).  As such, they are particularly well-suited to automated extraction and analysis.

RDF sports a formidable set of specifications (you may read them [[http://www.w3.org/RDF/ here]]).  Fortunately, many of its features have been implemented in third-party Ruby gems, including:

*   rdf-rdfa
*   sparql
*   and of course Ruby's own RDF module (part of its standard library).

This article is not intended as an introduction to RDF, but as an example of how powerful Zillabyte can be when combined with a set of rbobust third-party libraries.  Without further ado, here is a core snippet of the code we use to parse Indeed:

```ruby
<%= link_file("example_repo/job_openings/app.rb") %>

```

### Push it to our servers

```bash
$ zillabyte push
```

### Now your algorithm is being processed with our infrastructure!


With a few tweaks, you can use this code to extract semantic information from any page exposing information through RDF.
