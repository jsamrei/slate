How To: Predictive Online Advertising

Getting a benchmark for what other companies spend on marketing can help put your own efforts into perspective.  We boiled down the myriad factors to search for down to three indexes: commerce, social, and security. 

Commerce
Referencing a previous project, we build a commerce index that ranks sites based on the commerce tools they use.  Companies using these tools are seriously invested in getting the right data to drive their advertising efforts, and are likely spending more than most companies. 

Social
Companies that have invested time in their social media want to make the most of that effort.  Tweet promotions and Facebook boosts are common in social media advertising.  We build an index that rates a company on what social media they use to determine the likelihood of them spending money on these platforms.  Combined with their focused data from commerce tools they are even more likely to spend money on ads and promotions. 

Security
Our last factor is whether the company protects their data, specifically if they use SSL Certificates.  This seemingly simple item can be a clear indicator on who invests in themselves. Companies who go the extra mile for security have valuable marketing data to protect and the funds to advertise heavily as well. 

The Result
Looking at these indexes we propose that companies with higher rankings spend more on their advertising. Companies that invest time and funds acquiring marketing data, distribution channels, and protecting their data are more likely to also invest heavily in using that data to advertise.
