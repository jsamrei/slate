# Zillabyte FAQ

## What data is available for me to use in a Zillabyte App?

We are making some useful datasets publicly accessible for you to quickly get started. The first ones we are providing are `domains` and `web_pages`.  

## How do I get data into the Zillabyte ecosystem?

### Static data

Csv files should be uploaded using the CLI `relations:append` function.

### Streaming data

To input data into an app that is continously changing, use the source feature of the app to pull in data. 
  
## How do I get data out of the Zillabyte ecosystem?

### Pulling the entire result set
  - Command line flat file
  - Command line pull to s3

### Notifications
  - Within the flow

## How do I know the progress of my app?
